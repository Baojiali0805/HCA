Enhanced Human Fall Detection in Complex Envi-ronments via Hybrid Convolution and Attention Mechanisms

## Abstract

Pedestrian fall detection in complex scenes remains a critical challenge in computer vision, particularly for applications in public safety and intelligent surveillance. Such environments are often characterized by severe occlusions, multi-target interfer-ence, cluttered backgrounds, and variable lighting, which significantly degrade the performance of conventional detection models. To address these limitations, this paper introduces HCA-YOLO—a novel Hybrid Convolution and Attention-YOLO architecture built upon YOLOv11. The proposed model incorporates two key innovations: a Multi-Scale Feed-Forward Network (MSFN) in the backbone, which integrates deformable and multi-scale dilated convolutions to adaptively capture human pose variations and contextual features; and a light-weight Convolution and Attention Fusion Module (CAFM) in the neck, which enhances feature fusion through channel attention and depthwise separable convolution while suppressing back-ground noise.
